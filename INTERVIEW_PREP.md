## üéØ Key Talking Points

### 1. **Project Introduction (2-3 minutes)**
*"I built a complete DevOps pipeline for a beer catalog application that demonstrates infrastructure as code, containerization, and automated CI/CD. The project shows my ability to work with AWS, Terraform, Docker, and GitHub Actions from scratch."*

**Highlight:**
- End-to-end automation
- No prebuilt modules used
- Production-ready architecture
- Real problem-solving experience

### 2. **Technical Architecture (3-4 minutes)**
*"The architecture follows cloud-native best practices: Flask app containerized with Docker, deployed on ECS Fargate, connected to PostgreSQL RDS in a private subnet, all managed with Terraform and automated via GitHub Actions."*

**Key Components:**
- **Application Layer**: Flask with proper error handling
- **Containerization**: Secure Docker setup with non-root user
- **Infrastructure**: VPC with public/private subnets, security groups
- **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL with proper security
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

### 3. **Problem-Solving Stories (3-4 minutes)**
*"The project included intentional issues to test problem-solving skills. I documented 7+ issues and their solutions, with the most challenging being the ECS-RDS connectivity problem."*

**Key Issues Solved:**
- Database connection configuration
- Environment variable management
- Security group configurations
- Terraform state conflicts
- Container security improvements

### 4. **Technical Deep Dive (5-6 minutes)**
Be ready to explain:
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform modules and state management
- **Container Security**: Non-root containers, minimal base images
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs and metrics
- **Security**: IAM roles, security groups, VPC design

## üöÄ Live Demo Preparation

### Primary Demo Flow
1. **Show the application running locally**
   ```bash
   cd app/beer_catalog
   poetry run python -m flask --app beer_catalog/app run --debug
   curl http://localhost:5000/health
   curl http://localhost:5000/beers
   ```

2. **Demonstrate Docker containerization**
   ```bash
   docker build -t beer-catalog-app .
   docker run -p 5000:5000 beer-catalog-app
   ```

3. **Show infrastructure in AWS Console**
   - ECS cluster and service
   - RDS database
   - VPC and security groups
   - CloudWatch logs

4. **Walk through CI/CD pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Automated build and deploy
   - ECR image repository

### Backup Demo Options
- **Code walkthrough**: Explain key files and decisions
- **Screenshots**: Show AWS resources and configurations
- **Documentation**: Walk through README and troubleshooting guide

## üí¨ Expected Questions & Answers

### Technical Questions

**Q: "Walk me through your architecture"**
**A:** *"I built a containerized Flask app deployed on ECS Fargate. The app connects to PostgreSQL RDS in a private subnet, with all infrastructure managed by Terraform. Deployments are automated via GitHub Actions, and everything runs in a VPC with proper security groups."*

**Q: "What was the most challenging issue you solved?"**
**A:** *"The ECS-RDS connectivity issue was challenging. The app was trying to connect to localhost instead of the RDS endpoint. I debugged this through CloudWatch logs and fixed it by properly configuring the DATABASE_URL environment variable in the ECS task definition."*

**Q: "How would you scale this architecture?"**
**A:** *"I'd add an Application Load Balancer, implement auto-scaling based on CPU/memory, use read replicas for the database, and consider moving to Aurora Serverless. I'd also implement blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates."*

**Q: "What security measures did you implement?"**
**A:** *"I use IAM roles with least privilege, security groups to restrict traffic, RDS in private subnets, and non-root containers. I avoid hardcoded secrets and use environment variables for configuration."*

### Behavioral Questions

**Q: "Tell me about a time you solved a complex technical problem"**
**A:** *"In this project, I faced multiple infrastructure issues. The most complex was debugging the ECS-RDS connectivity problem. I systematically checked CloudWatch logs, verified security group configurations, and eventually found the issue was with environment variable configuration. This taught me the importance of systematic debugging and proper documentation."*

**Q: "How do you stay current with DevOps practices?"**
**A:** *"I follow a structured learning approach, as outlined in my study plan. I focus on hands-on projects, official documentation, and community involvement. I'm actively working toward AWS and Terraform certifications."*

**Q: "What would you improve in your project?"**
**A:** *"I'd add comprehensive monitoring with CloudWatch dashboards, implement secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager, add automated testing, and implement blue-green deployments. I'd also add infrastructure cost optimization and performance monitoring."*
