## DevOps Principles Applied

### 12-Factor App Compliance
- [ ] Codebase: Single codebase tracked in version control
- [ ] Dependencies: Explicitly declared and isolated
- [ ] Config: Stored in environment variables (FIXED)
- [ ] Backing Services: Treated as attached resources (PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Build, Release, Run: Strictly separated build and run stages
- [ ] Processes: Stateless and share-nothing
- [ ] Port Binding: Self-contained and export services via port binding
- [ ] Concurrency: Scale out via the process model
- [ ] Disposability: Fast startup and graceful shutdown
- [ ] Dev/Prod Parity: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
- [ ] Logs: Treat logs as event streams
- [ ] Admin Processes: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

### SOLID Principles in Infrastructure
- **Single Responsibility**: Each Terraform module has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Infrastructure can be extended without modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Modules can be replaced with compatible alternatives
- **Interface Segregation**: Use specific IAM policies and security groups
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions (variables) not concrete implementations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Application runs locally with virtual environment
- [ ] Application runs in Docker container securely
- [ ] Infrastructure provisions successfully with Terraform
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline builds and deploys automatically
- [ ] Application is accessible and functional in AWS
- [ ] **ALL intentional issues are identified and resolved**
- [ ] Documentation is complete and clear
- [ ] Code follows best practices and is maintainable
- [ ] **Security issues are addressed**
- [ ] **Error handling is robust**

## Time Allocation Summary
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 hours (Foundation + Critical Fixes)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 hours (Planning)
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 hours (Implementation)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 hours (Automation)
- **Phase 5**: 1-2 hours (Testing & Documentation)

**Total Estimated Time**: 10-15 hours

## Key Changes from Original Schedule

### **Phase 1 Enhancements:**
- **Critical fixes first**: Address the most important issues before building infrastructure
- **Security focus**: Fix Docker and application security issues early
- **Error handling**: Add robust error handling before deployment

### **Phase 2 Enhancements:**
- **Issue-aware planning**: Design infrastructure that specifically addresses the "gotchas"
- **Security by design**: Plan security measures from the beginning

### **Phase 3-5 Enhancements:**
- **Validation focus**: Ensure each phase validates the fixes from previous phases
- **Documentation**: Track all issues and their resolutions

## Notes
- Each phase now specifically addresses the identified "gotchas"
- The schedule prioritizes fixing critical issues before building infrastructure
- Security and error handling are addressed early and throughout
- Documentation includes tracking of all issues found and resolved
- Focus on quality and best practices rather than rushing to completion
