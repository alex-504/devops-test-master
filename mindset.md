## Mindset
Hi, this is a coding assignment to a DevOps role.
I want your help to complete it. I prfer not get it all done, at once, since one important aspect is to be able to explain it.

So the approach is very simple.
I have to be able to follow the instructions provided oin @instructions.md ( I added it from the email the recruiter sent), and this should be clear enough.

Please, help me to figure out the best order of solving tasks, considering DEvOps reasoning, (for example, if it makes sense to add docker earlier to improve the different environments, let's do this first (for example), I am not very experienced in DevOps, but will try to use this task to leverage my skills at the same time I need you to share and explain what is happening while we work, clear?

We want to use the best practices of DevOps, and the best tools for the job.

We want to use 12-factor app principles, and the best practices of DevOps.

We want to use SOLID priciples to write the code.

We want to document the code, as the recruiter will asses my organization skills.

We want to respect the Instructions file, and meet all points necesszry to get it done, and be able to explain.


## Let's fix the app, then deploy it porperly.
There are some issues in the app, and we need to fix them.
